I want you to complete the remaining bilingual integration tasks for my full-stack project (React + Vite frontend, Node.js backend).  

Specifically, finish the following steps:

1. **Improve Language Switching Feature (Frontend):**
   - Implement a clean and user-friendly language switcher in the appâ€™s header or top navigation bar.
   - Use a dropdown or toggle that shows both languages with flags (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ English / ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¦ Arabic).
   - Make sure switching languages updates all visible text immediately without requiring a page reload.
   - Ensure the app updates `dir` (direction) to `rtl` or `ltr` correctly when switching languages.
   - Save the userâ€™s language preference in `localStorage` and automatically apply it on page reload.

2. **Testing in Both Languages:**
   - Systematically test every page (home, dashboard, login, forms, error pages, modals, menus, validation messages, etc.) in both Arabic and English.
   - Verify that:
     - All text changes correctly when switching languages.
     - Layout direction (RTL/LTR) switches properly.
     - No untranslated or leftover Arabic/English text remains.
     - Both frontend and backend error/validation messages are returned in the selected language.
   - Fix any language switching issues found during testing.

3. **Remove Leftover Text & Organize Code:**
   - Search the entire project for any **hardcoded text** in components, backend responses, or validation messages, and replace them with proper translation keys.
   - Remove any unused variables, old translation strings, or Arabic-only text that is no longer needed.
   - Organize the translation files to make them consistent and well-structured.
   - Clean up the codebase to ensure it's maintainable and ready for production.

After completing these steps, give me a final summary including:
- Confirmation that language switching is working perfectly.
- A list of pages/components where fixes were made.
- A note on any remaining issues (if any).
